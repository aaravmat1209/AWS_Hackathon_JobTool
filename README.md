## üß© Overview

The **Agentic Job Search Assistant** leverages AWS Bedrock‚Äôs agentic capabilities to automate the end-to-end student job search process ‚Äî from **resume parsing** to **daily career recommendations**.

It integrates **real-time user interactions** (via live search) with **automated batch processes** (for job matching and communication), providing a seamless and intelligent job discovery experience.

### üåü Key Features
- **Multi-Agent System (AgentCore):**  
  Includes a *Routing Agent*, *Career Exploration Agent*, and *Job Search Agent* for modular and dynamic decision-making.
- **AI-Powered Resume Parsing:**  
  Extracts key entities and skills using **Nova Pro** and stores structured student profiles in DynamoDB.
- **Automated Notifications:**  
  Sends **daily job updates via AWS SES (email)** and **SNS (SMS)**.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:**  
  Uses **Amazon EventBridge** and **SQS** for time-triggered and asynchronous job processing.
- **Knowledge Graph + RAG:**  
  Combines **Bedrock Knowledge Base**, **Graph RAG**, and **Neptune Graph** for context-aware job matching and career exploration.
- **Secure File Storage:**  
  User resumes and resources are securely managed in **Amazon S3**.

</p>

### üîç Architecture Overview

The system is divided into three main modules:

#### 1. **Live Search**
- Students upload resumes ‚Üí stored in **Amazon S3**.  
- **Lambda + Nova Pro** parses resumes and extracts skills.  
- Processed profiles are stored via API Gateway ‚Üí DynamoDB.  
- AgentCore runtime routes user queries to the appropriate agent:
  - **Career Exploration Agent:** Provides insights and skill-based recommendations.  
  - **Job Search Agent:** Fetches job postings and returns AI-filtered results.

#### 2. **Job Search Batch Process**
- Triggered daily via **Amazon EventBridge**.  
- Lambda adds new student job search tasks to **Amazon SQS** queue.  
- Another Lambda processes queued tasks to perform job searches and updates DynamoDB with results.

#### 3. **Communication Batch Process**
- Triggered daily at configurable times (e.g., 9 AM).  
- Fetches new job recommendations from DynamoDB.  
- Sends personalized **email and SMS notifications** using:
  - **Amazon SES (Email Service)**  
  - **Amazon SNS (SMS Service)**

#### 4. **Knowledge Infrastructure**
- **Bedrock Knowledge Base** connects with:
  - **S3 Vector Store:** Stores semantic embeddings of career resources.  
  - **Neptune Graph:** Stores relational data between jobs, skills, and industries.  
  - **Graph RAG:** Enhances contextual retrieval for AI-driven responses.
